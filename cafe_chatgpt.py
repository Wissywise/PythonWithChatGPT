"""✅ How it works:
Applies age-based discount first. Adds an extra 5% if the customer has a loyalty card. Calculates and prints the final 
price rounded to 2 decimal places. Includes basic error handling for invalid inputs. If you'd like, I can also show 
you a version where discounts are applied sequentially instead of combined."""
